OpenSAML-J
=============================================

OpenSAML-J is a low-level library that allow developers to work with XML in a
Java beans manner.

OpenSAML-J requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers,
and this library requires the use of Xerces and Xalan for historical reasons.
We recommend those libraries be endorsed using the endorsement override
mechanism in the JVM to ensure their use.

The use of JDK 1.6 or higher is required. Older Java versions are not
supported.

OpenSAML-J is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.
